Hi, I’m @MathBalogh
I’m currently interested in learning c++ and building software rendering engines. I have successfully built a triangle rasterizer, a ray-marcher with the phong reflection model,
and a few ray-tracers with depth-of-field, fast-approximate anti-aliasing, reflections, refractions, and many other features.
I’m currently learning c++, and am learning more about rendering every day.
